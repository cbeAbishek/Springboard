# Testing Framework using Java, Maven, and Spring Boot

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a **Testing Framework** using **Java**, **Maven**, and **Spring Boot**. It was developed as part of an Infosys internship project to ensure modular, scalable, and maintainable automated tests for Spring Boot applications.

---

## Features

* **Spring Boot Integration** for application testing.
* **JUnit** for unit and integration testing.
* **Maven** for dependency management and build automation.
* **Test Suites** for organized test execution.
* **Environment Configuration** using `application.properties` and profiles.
* **Extensible Structure** for adding new test cases easily.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

* **Java 17** or above
* **Apache Maven** (latest version)
* **Spring Boot** (via Maven dependencies)
* **IDE** like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

## Steps to Create the Framework

### 1. **Initialize Maven Project**

* Use Maven archetype to create a Spring Boot project.
* Configure `pom.xml` for dependencies:

    * Spring Boot Starter
    * Spring Boot Starter Test
    * JUnit 5

### 2. **Configure Application Properties**

* Set test-specific properties in `src/test/resources/application-test.properties`.
* Use Spring Profiles to separate dev, test, and prod configurations.

### 3. **Write Test Classes**

* Create unit tests for individual components (services, controllers).
* Implement integration tests for end-to-end flow using Spring Boot Test.
* Use annotations like `@SpringBootTest`, `@Test`, `@BeforeAll`, and `@AfterAll`.

### 4. **Organize Test Suites**

* Group related tests into suites for efficient execution.
* Define suite classes to run multiple tests together.

### 5. **Run Tests**

* Execute tests via Maven:

  ```
  mvn test
  ```
* View test results in the console or generated reports.

## Best Practices

* Follow **naming conventions** for test classes and methods.
* Maintain **separate configuration files** for different environments.
* Use **mocking frameworks** like Mockito for dependency isolation.
* Ensure **high code coverage** for critical components.

---

## Deliverables

* Complete Maven-based Spring Boot testing framework.
* Comprehensive test cases for the application.
* Documentation of test execution steps and reports.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add support for **TestNG** for advanced testing features.
* Integrate **SonarQube** for code quality analysis.
* Include **Continuous Integration (CI)** using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
