# Test Report Fixes - Screenshots and Error Details

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Test Case Details Not Showing in Report
**Problem**: Test case details were not properly displayed on the report page.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `TestListener.java` to properly capture and store test details including error messages, stack traces, and screenshots
- Added comprehensive error information to `TestReportDetail` entity
- Ensured proper database persistence of test results

### 2. Failed Test Reasons Not Showing Properly
**Problem**: Error messages and stack traces were not properly displayed for failed tests.

**Solution**:
- Added `@Attachment` support in Allure for error messages and stack traces
- Enhanced error message capture in both `TestListener.java` and `ScreenshotListener.java`
- Implemented full stack trace logging (limited to 5000 characters to prevent overflow)
- Added Allure attachments for:
  - Error Message (text/plain)
  - Full Stack Trace (text/plain)
  - Test descriptions

### 3. Screenshots Not Showing for Failed UI Tests
**Problem**: Screenshots were captured but not properly attached to Allure reports.

**Solution**:
- Integrated Allure screenshot attachment in `ScreenshotUtils.java`
- Enhanced `ScreenshotListener.java` with Allure integration
- Screenshots are now:
  - Saved to `target/screenshots/` directory
  - Attached to Allure reports automatically
  - Stored in database with proper paths
  - Accessible via custom report dashboard

## Modified Files

### 1. `/src/test/java/org/automation/listeners/TestListener.java`
**Changes**:
- Added Allure import: `io.qameta.allure.Allure`
- Added `@Attachment` annotation for text attachments
- Enhanced `onTestFailure()` to attach screenshots and error details to Allure
- Added `attachTextToAllure()` method for error messages and stack traces
- Added `attachScreenshotToAllure()` method for screenshot attachments
- Improved error message and stack trace capture

### 2. `/src/test/java/org/automation/listeners/ScreenshotListener.java`
**Changes**:
- Added `@Component` annotation to make it a valid Spring bean
- Added Allure integration for screenshot attachments
- Enhanced `onTestFailure()` to:
  - Capture screenshots for UI tests
  - Attach screenshots to Allure reports
  - Attach error details and stack traces to Allure
  - Store screenshot paths in database
- Added `attachScreenshotToAllure()` method
- Added `getStackTraceAsString()` method for detailed error logging

### 3. `/src/test/java/org/automation/utils/ScreenshotUtils.java`
**Changes**:
- Added Allure integration for automatic screenshot attachment
- Enhanced `capture()` method to attach screenshots to Allure
- Enhanced `captureToPath()` method to attach screenshots to Allure
- Added SLF4J logging instead of System.out.println
- Screenshots are now automatically attached to both:
  - File system (target/screenshots/)
  - Allure report (allure-results/)

## How It Works

### For Failed UI Tests:
1. Test fails
2. `TestListener` captures error message and stack trace
3. `ScreenshotListener` detects it's a UI test (based on class name)
4. Screenshot is captured and saved to `target/screenshots/`
5. Screenshot is attached to Allure report
6. Error message and stack trace are attached to Allure report
7. All information is saved to database
8. Information is available in both Allure and custom dashboard reports

### For Failed API Tests:
1. Test fails
2. `TestListener` captures error message and stack trace
3. Error details are attached to Allure report
4. All information is saved to database
5. Information is available in both Allure and custom dashboard reports

## Viewing Reports

### Allure Reports:
```bash
# Generate and open Allure report
mvn allure:serve

# Or generate static report
mvn allure:report
```

The Allure report will now show:
- Screenshots for failed UI tests
- Error messages as text attachments
- Full stack traces as text attachments
- Test descriptions and metadata

### Custom Dashboard Reports:
```bash
# Access via browser
http://localhost:8080/dashboard/reports

# View execution report
http://localhost:8080/dashboard/execution-report?id=RPT_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_XXXX
```

The custom dashboard will show:
- Test case details with error messages
- Screenshots for failed UI tests (clickable to view full size)
- Stack traces in expandable sections
- API request/response details for API tests

## Testing the Fixes

### Run UI Tests:
```bash
mvn clean test -Dtest=*UITest -Dbrowser=chrome
```

### Run API Tests:
```bash
mvn clean test -Dtest=*APITest
```

### Run All Tests and Generate Reports:
```bash
mvn clean test
mvn allure:serve
```

## Configuration

### Enable Success Screenshots (Optional):
```bash
mvn test -Dcapture.success.screenshots=true
```

### Specify Browser:
```bash
mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome
# or
mvn test -Dbrowser=firefox
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Test Visibility**: All test failures now include screenshots (for UI) and detailed error information
2. **Better Debugging**: Full stack traces help identify root causes quickly
3. **Professional Reports**: Allure reports now show all relevant failure information
4. **Database Integration**: All data is persisted for historical analysis
5. **Dual Reporting**: Information available in both Allure and custom dashboard

## Notes

- Screenshots are only captured for tests in packages containing: `ui`, `UI`, `Selenium`, `Web`, or `browser`
- Stack traces are limited to 5000 characters to prevent memory issues
- Error messages in database are limited to 500 characters
- Screenshots are stored in `target/screenshots/` and served via `/screenshots/**` endpoint
- All listeners work in both Maven CLI and UI-triggered test executions
